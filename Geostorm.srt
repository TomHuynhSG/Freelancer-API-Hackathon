00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:27,115
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>or beachfronts.</i></font>

16
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:31,135
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We lost entire cities.</i></font>

22

23
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,711
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>could solve this problem alone.</i></font>

24

to neutralize the storms...</i></font>

32
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,965
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>with a net of
thousands of satellites...</i></font>

a technical name...</i></font>

38

<font color=#FFFF5E><i>put we all came
to call it "Dutch Boy"...</i></font>

39
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,703

with his finger.</i></font>

44
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,162
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Thanks, boss.
- Keep the change.</font>

45
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:16,465
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, Jake Lawson. I have a...</font>

46
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,066
<font color=#FFFF5E>Senate hearing, room 12.</font>

47
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:18,864
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

48
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,066
<font color=#FFFF5E>Lawson?</font>

49
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,223
<font color=#FFFF5E>- You're the Dutch Boy guy, right?
- Yeah.</font>

50
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,023
<font color=#FFFF5E>Man, I need to shake your hand.</font>

51
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:25,123
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, okay.</font>

52
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,073
<font color=#FFFF5E>Tornado. Zap.</font>

53
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:28,935
<font color=#FFFF5E>Blizzard. Zap.</font>

54
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:30,337
<font color=#FFFF5E>Monsoon?</font>

55
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,498
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Zap?
- Zap!</font>

56
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:35,338
<font color=#FFFF5E>Everybody down here owes you,
Jake Lawson.</font>

57
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,978
<font color=#FFFF5E>If you need anything,
you just ask.</font>

58
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:54,062
<font color=#FFFF5E>The Senate Committee assigned
to oversee Dutch Boy...</font>

59
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,475
<font color=#FFFF5E>will now hear from Jacob Lawson,</font>

60
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:00,003
<font color=#FFFF5E>Climate ISS,
Chief Operations Coordinator.</font>

61
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:03,520
<font color=#FFFF5E>May the record reflect that
he was nearly one hour late.</font>

62
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,988
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, sorry 'bout that, uh.</font>

63
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,155
<font color=#FFFF5E>I literally had to fly in
from outer space.</font>

64
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:12,208
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, here we go.</font>

65
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:16,196
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mr. Lawson, we find ourselves
heading toward a crossroads.</font>

66
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:19,282
<font color=#FFFF5E>As you know,
as per UN Resolution 28-14,</font>

67
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:23,152
<font color=#FFFF5E>the United States will be
handing over control of Dutch Boy</font>

68
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:26,639
<font color=#FFFF5E>to an international oversight
committee in three years.</font>

69
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,679
<font color=#FFFF5E>This in spite of the fact that
we actually built the thing.</font>

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,999
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, excuse me, Senator,
I-I don't wanna slow things down.</font>

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,815
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's just the you said, "we" built it?</font>

72
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,672
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, indeed I did.</font>

73
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,750
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because I know what I did.</font>

74
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:42,147
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm the guy that led the team
that built the station.</font>

75
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,814
<font color=#FFFF5E>I was up there with a
international crew of 600 people...</font>

76
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,410
<font color=#FFFF5E>not just Americans.
And I know all of their faces, but...</font>

77
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,410
<font color=#FFFF5E>I don't remember yours.</font>

78
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:56,168
<font color=#FFFF5E>We had a-a plumber up there.
He looked a little like you.</font>

79
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:59,356
<font color=#FFFF5E>Very clever, Mr. Lawson.</font>

80
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,498
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, Dutch Boy was
an international effort.</font>

81
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,185
<font color=#FFFF5E>And yes, it may one day,
very well belong to the world.</font>

82
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,483
<font color=#FFFF5E>But until it does, we have
authority over its operation.</font>

83
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,078
<font color=#FFFF5E>And we have authority over you.</font>

84
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,470
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you have been
flouting that authority.</font>

85
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:17,293
<font color=#FFFF5E>I-I have report after report here.</font>

86
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:19,778
<font color=#FFFF5E>"Failure to follow procedures".</font>

87
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,122
<font color=#FFFF5E>Numerous violations
of the chain of command.</font>

88
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,950
<font color=#FFFF5E>And then, there was the
incident where you punched</font>

89
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:28,291
<font color=#FFFF5E>a federal inspector in the face.</font>

90
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,381
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, your federal inspector
doesn't know</font>

91
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,288
<font color=#FFFF5E>that a capacitor holds a charge
even when it's disconnected.</font>

92
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:36,220
<font color=#FFFF5E>He was grabbing for the damn thing.
I saved his life.</font>

93
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,766
<font color=#FFFF5E>You can make all the
excuses you want, Mr. Lawson.</font>

94
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,356
<font color=#FFFF5E>But there's one thing
you cannot defend.</font>

95
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:46,090
<font color=#FFFF5E>And that would be the day
you brought Dutch Boy online</font>

96
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,786
<font color=#FFFF5E>and operational without our consent.</font>

97
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,547
<font color=#FFFF5E>And what would that
have taken, Senator?</font>

98
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,176
<font color=#FFFF5E>There were a series
of storms building</font>

99
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,874
<font color=#FFFF5E>in Southeast Asia
and the North Atlantic</font>

100
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:57,726
<font color=#FFFF5E>that would have killed
tens of thousands of people.</font>

101
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,560
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dutch Boy was ready.
We went green.</font>

102
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,145
<font color=#FFFF5E>It works. You're welcome.</font>

103
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:05,898
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mr. Lawson, if you continue
to defy our authority,</font>

104
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,867
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dutch Boy will go on
without you!</font>

105
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,571
<font color=#FFFF5E>Am I making myself clear?</font>

106
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:20,568
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes.</font>

107
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,645
<font color=#FFFF5E>Good.
Oh, and one more thing.</font>

108
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,422
<font color=#FFFF5E>To ensure compliance,</font>

109
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,998
<font color=#FFFF5E>this committee will be sending up
new support staff.</font>

110
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,062
<font color=#FFFF5E>Naturally, when they get up there,</font>

111
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,403
<font color=#FFFF5E>you'll have to send some of
your people home.</font>

112
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:34,802
<font color=#FFFF5E>We'll leave those choices up to you.</font>

113
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,477
<font color=#FFFF5E>Senator, respectfully,</font>

114
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,056
<font color=#FFFF5E>my crew didn't do
anything wrong.</font>

115
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:41,392
<font color=#FFFF5E>Excuse me,
I'm not asking for your input.</font>

116
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,877
<font color=#FFFF5E>These people left their homes,</font>

117
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,941
<font color=#FFFF5E>and their families,
and risked their lives...</font>

118
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,853
<font color=#FFFF5E>- to save this planet.
- This hearing is adjourned.</font>

119
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,854
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not cutting a single one
of those people loose!</font>

120
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:50,936
<font color=#FFFF5E>Excuse me?</font>

121
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:53,875
<font color=#FFFF5E>People like you need people
like me. You know why?</font>

122
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:56,574
<font color=#FFFF5E>So you can take credit
for everything we accomplish.</font>

123
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:58,754
<font color=#FFFF5E>So you can go to your constituents</font>

124
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,256
<font color=#FFFF5E>- and your cronies.
- This meeting is adjourned.</font>

125
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:03,034
<font color=#FFFF5E>And your mistresses.
And pump out your chest</font>

126
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:05,123
<font color=#FFFF5E>- and say, "Hey, look at me!"
- Sit down, please!</font>

127
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,764
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Well, I'm looking, Senator.
- Excuse me.</font>

128
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,661
<font color=#FFFF5E>- We're all looking.
- This meeting is adjourned.</font>

129
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,489
<font color=#FFFF5E>This meeting is adjourned!
Thank you.</font>

130
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,758
<font color=#FFFF5E>That was going well, huh?</font>

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,167
<font color=#FFFF5E>Up to a point.</font>

132
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,706
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, Jake, that didn't go well
at any point.</font>

133
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,407
<font color=#FFFF5E>But hey, what are you good at,
little brother, huh?</font>

134
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,898
<font color=#FFFF5E>Like workin' the angles,
smoothin' ruffled feathers.</font>

135
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,550
<font color=#FFFF5E>You can fix it.
You always do.</font>

136
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,909
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's like a talent.</font>

137
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,911
<font color=#FFFF5E>It <i>is</i> a talent.</font>

138
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,218
<font color=#FFFF5E>Of a sort.</font>

139
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,356
<font color=#FFFF5E>I wish I could help you,
I really do.</font>

140
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:40,880
<font color=#FFFF5E>But it's not that simple.</font>

141
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,481
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not this time.</font>

142
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,482
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why not?</font>

143
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,794
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, as of last week,</font>

144
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,353
<font color=#FFFF5E>they have put me
in charge of Dutch Boy.</font>

145
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,761
<font color=#FFFF5E>But that's great!</font>

146
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,184
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's great!
You kidding me?</font>

147
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,835
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're kidding me.</font>

148
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,837
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, what do you
want me to do, huh?</font>

149
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,322
<font color=#FFFF5E>You leave me no choice.
I told you.</font>

150
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:12,786
<font color=#FFFF5E>This had to go well,
and it didn't.</font>

151
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,976
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, I-I'm sorry, Jake.</font>

152
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:22,695
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're fired.</font>

153
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:49,308
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jesus. It's over 120
in this mother.</font>

154
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,590
<font color=#FFFF5E>Fan out.</font>

155
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,610
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, Agent Wilson.</font>

156
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,712
<font color=#FFFF5E>Assistant Secretary Lawson.</font>

157
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,186
<font color=#FFFF5E>You look nice today.</font>

158
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,839
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm wearing the
same thing I always wear.</font>

159
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,423
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ah, exactly.</font>

160
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:19,298
<font color=#FFFF5E>Have you seen I uh,
got on a new tie?</font>

161
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:21,115
<font color=#FFFF5E>I observed.</font>

162
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:24,567
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're trained to notice any
disturbing details.</font>

163
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,363
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sarah, come on,
can we just drop...</font>

164
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:29,444
<font color=#FFFF5E>Assistant Secretary Lawson.</font>

165
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,046
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not permitted to engage in</font>

166
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,551
<font color=#FFFF5E>casual conversation
while I'm at a post.</font>

167
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:36,357
<font color=#FFFF5E>We are being watched.</font>

168
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,617
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're always being watched.</font>

169
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:40,778
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, if we're
always being watched</font>

170
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:42,289
<font color=#FFFF5E>then what's the
point of hiding anything?</font>

171
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,650
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're interfering with my duties.
I'd rather not shoot you.</font>

172
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,166
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, it would be an honor</font>

173
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,020
<font color=#FFFF5E>to be the first person
that you kill.</font>

174
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,082
<font color=#FFFF5E>Damn it.</font>

175
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:53,783
<font color=#FFFF5E>What is it.</font>

176
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,446
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, the President's
called a security briefing.</font>

177
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,365
<font color=#FFFF5E>It was not on the schedule, so.</font>

178
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,479
<font color=#FFFF5E>I guess I'm now on duty.</font>

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,647
<font color=#FFFF5E>I like the tie.
Home by 7. Love you.</font>

180
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:07,486
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.</font>

181
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:08,788
<font color=#FFFF5E>I didn't say anything.</font>

182
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>Move along, sir.</font>

183
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:12,792
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, ma'am.</font>

184
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,008
<font color=#FFFF5E>What the hell happened here?</font>

185
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,786
<font color=#FFFF5E>One of our thermospheric
satellites</font>

186
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,340
<font color=#FFFF5E>malfunctioned over Afghanistan.</font>

187
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,543
<font color=#FFFF5E>A UN recon team found it,
Mr. President.</font>

188
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,845
<font color=#FFFF5E>And the members of the
Climate Council, they're aware?</font>

189
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:26,127
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, and they've all agreed
to keep the incident discreet.</font>

190
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,401
<font color=#FFFF5E>But with this many people
in the loop,</font>

191
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:28,697
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not sure how long
it's gonna keep.</font>

192
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,418
<font color=#FFFF5E>And we're sure this was
caused by Dutch Boy?</font>

193
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,551
<font color=#FFFF5E>Absolutely.</font>

194
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,878
<font color=#FFFF5E>Can we assume that
this is an isolated incident?</font>

195
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,718
<font color=#FFFF5E>Doctor Quigley?</font>

196
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,343
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're fairly certain, yes.</font>

197
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,715
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's great to know
that you're "fairly certain".</font>

198
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,317
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is a serious malfunction.</font>

199
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,708
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, your proposal is what?</font>

200
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,266
<font color=#FFFF5E>Simple. We shut down
all Central Asian satellites</font>

201
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:45,568
<font color=#FFFF5E>until we know what went wrong.</font>

202
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,182
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.</font>

203
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:48,693
<font color=#FFFF5E>Do you know how difficult it was
to get every one of these</font>

204
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:49,849
<font color=#FFFF5E>nations online for this?</font>

205
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,351
<font color=#FFFF5E>We have worked extremely hard</font>

206
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,112
<font color=#FFFF5E>to assure these nations</font>

207
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,276
<font color=#FFFF5E>that this system will protect them.
And it has.</font>

208
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,339
<font color=#FFFF5E>And let's not forget, people,
it's an election year.</font>

209
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,750
<font color=#FFFF5E>We shut Dutch Boy down,
the press is gonna jump all over this.</font>

210
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,551
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, my God.</font>

211
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,309
<font color=#FFFF5E>300 people died in that village.</font>

212
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,034
<font color=#FFFF5E>Who gives a damn
about the politics of it all?</font>

213
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,918
<font color=#FFFF5E>We cost those people their lives.</font>

214
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,847
<font color=#FFFF5E>The only thing we
should be concerned</font>

215
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,264
<font color=#FFFF5E>about here is how to fix it and</font>

216
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,046
<font color=#FFFF5E>making sure it never happens again.</font>

217
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,139
<font color=#FFFF5E>And how do you propose
we do that?</font>

218
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,256
<font color=#FFFF5E>We can't do anything.</font>

219
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:26,046
<font color=#FFFF5E>What I mean is, the problem
is not gonna be solved in this room</font>

220
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:28,430
<font color=#FFFF5E>and well, certainly not by us.</font>

221
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:32,025
<font color=#FFFF5E>We need an international team
on the station itself.</font>

222
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,527
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not suits.</font>

223
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,282
<font color=#FFFF5E>Engineers, coders, builders,</font>

224
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,582
<font color=#FFFF5E>doing a comprehensive
systems check.</font>

225
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,916
<font color=#FFFF5E>No matter the cost,
no matter the politics.</font>

226
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,893
<font color=#FFFF5E>We need them up there now.</font>

227
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,514
<font color=#FFFF5E>We are set to transfer
full authority for Dutch Boy</font>

228
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,300
<font color=#FFFF5E>to the international
community in two weeks.</font>

229
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,107
<font color=#FFFF5E>I will not be the President
that hands over damaged goods.</font>

230
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,720
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not now, not ever.</font>

231
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:59,104
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, <i>we</i> are gonna handle this
problem and its solution in-house.</font>

232
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,113
<font color=#FFFF5E>And we are gonna send up one man.</font>

233
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:05,871
<font color=#FFFF5E>One of our own
who reports only to us</font>

234
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,360
<font color=#FFFF5E>and that we can control.</font>

235
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,293
<font color=#FFFF5E>Understood?</font>

236
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,090
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, find me that someone.</font>

237
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,094
<font color=#FFFF5E>Now.</font>

238
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,686
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, sir.</font>

239
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,483
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, I know you're
not gonna like it</font>

240
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:21,778
<font color=#FFFF5E>but as I see it,
there's only one person</font>

241
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:22,779
<font color=#FFFF5E>to go after for this.</font>

242
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:23,870
<font color=#FFFF5E>Your brother, Jake.</font>

243
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,112
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, not Jake, please.</font>

244
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,872
<font color=#FFFF5E>17 countries, hmm?</font>

245
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,300
<font color=#FFFF5E>17 countries had teams
workin' on Dutch Boy.</font>

246
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:30,304
<font color=#FFFF5E>They all reported to him.</font>

247
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>Nobody knows what's under
the hood better than him.</font>

248
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,643
<font color=#FFFF5E>Can we weigh other options?</font>

249
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,449
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max, how long have you known me?</font>

250
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,526
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ever since I was transferred
to the State Department.</font>

251
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,124
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's right.
I handpicked you.</font>

252
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,427
<font color=#FFFF5E>I believed in you.
You're smart.</font>

253
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,876
<font color=#FFFF5E>And I was right about you.</font>

254
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,363
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm right about Jake.</font>

255
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,667
<font color=#FFFF5E>If this is gonna be a problem...</font>

256
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,849
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, sir.</font>

257
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,298
<font color=#FFFF5E>Good.</font>

258
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,590
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Afghan satellite zero-niner-six

268
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:24,967

269
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:26,923
<font color=#FFFF5E>Make sure they depressurize
the fuel intake.</font>

270
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,035
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, we got it.</font>

<font color=#FFFF5E>Makmoud. Oi, Makmoud!</font>

272
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,267
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm about to obliterate
your top score here, pal.</font>

273
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,749
<font color=#FFFF5E>I have to do some reprogramming.</font>

274
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,951

278
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:40,970
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, no, no!</font>

279
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,314
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uncle Max?</font>

280
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,682
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey! What you doin' up there?</font>

281
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:16,124
<font color=#FFFF5E>What is that, a solar generator?</font>

282
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,495
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dual-access, sun-tracking
solar generator.</font>

283

your dad every day.</font>

286
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,820
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, where'd he find that?</font>

287
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,169
<font color=#FFFF5E>You seriously asking that question?</font>

288
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,370
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, of course.</font>

289
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,344

00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,245
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ah, it's good to see you!</font>

291
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,047
<font color=#FFFF5E>How you doin'?
You okay?</font>

292
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,067
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm really great.</font>

293
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,669
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, what's goin' on here?</font>

294
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,053
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, this is
freakin' me out.</font>

295
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,494
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're supposed to
be nine years old.</font>

296
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,642
<font color=#FFFF5E>Thirteen.</font>

297
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,981
<font color=#FFFF5E>You were supposed
to be part of my life.</font>

298
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:47,872
<font color=#FFFF5E>But shit happens.</font>

299
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,274
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ouch.</font>

300
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,830
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, what's goin' on here?
You living with him?</font>

301
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:55,158
<font color=#FFFF5E>He gets me two weekends a month.</font>

302
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,974
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, good.
Uh, how's your mom?</font>

303
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,478
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mmm, justifiably pissed.</font>

304
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I bet.</font>

305
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,911
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hannah, it's time.</font>

306
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,628
<font color=#FFFF5E>What's up, Jake?</font>

307
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:13,930
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hannah, I thought I told you
not to talk to strangers.</font>

308
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,666
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, don't listen to him.</font>

309
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,607
<font color=#FFFF5E>Your dad and I were your age,</font>

310
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:20,197
<font color=#FFFF5E>we were so close,
we had our own secret code.</font>

311
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,153
<font color=#FFFF5E>- It's true.
- Really?</font>

312
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,934
<font color=#FFFF5E>I don't remember that.</font>

313
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:25,936
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, you do.</font>

314
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,429
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, I don't.</font>

315
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,371
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, it was nice seeing you.</font>

316
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,066
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, look.
You take care.</font>

317
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,799
<font color=#FFFF5E>What's with all the car parts?</font>

318
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:51,166
<font color=#FFFF5E>I build electric motors for
the retirees down at Vero Beach.</font>

319
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:52,468
<font color=#FFFF5E>Keeps me busy.</font>

320
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,432
<font color=#FFFF5E>Seems hardly worth your talent.</font>

321
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,730
<font color=#FFFF5E>You kidding?</font>

322
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:59,414
<font color=#FFFF5E>The time of my life.</font>

323
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,086
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's a little early,
don't you think?</font>

324
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,744
<font color=#FFFF5E>I got fired by my own brother.</font>

325
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,433
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then I lost my family.</font>

326
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,462
<font color=#FFFF5E>My house, my dog, so.</font>

327
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,544
<font color=#FFFF5E>Happy hour starts
around 11 out here.</font>

328
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,708
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, saw your niece,
you don't want a beer.</font>

329
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,710
<font color=#FFFF5E>Road's that way.</font>

330
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,884
<font color=#FFFF5E>There's somethin' wrong
with Dutch Boy.</font>

331
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, there isn't.</font>

332
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,519
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, an entire village of dead
Afghans may disagree with you.</font>

333
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:36,385
<font color=#FFFF5E>And then yesterday, an airlock just
just opened by itself.</font>

334
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:37,807
<font color=#FFFF5E>We lost one of our crew.</font>

335
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,614
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dutch Boy is not my problem anymore.</font>

336
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:42,210
<font color=#FFFF5E>That, I am calling bullshit on.</font>

337
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,925
<font color=#FFFF5E>'Cause other than you daughter
and your precious soccer club,</font>

338
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,545
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dutch Boy was all you
ever gave a damn about.</font>

339
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,046
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, yeah, once.</font>

340
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,165
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, but you took care of that.</font>

341
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,740
<font color=#FFFF5E>You don't care?</font>

342
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,142
<font color=#FFFF5E>No?</font>

343
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,532
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well then, what are you
doin' livin' out here?</font>

344
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,536
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hmm?</font>

345
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,478
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, I know you
think I'm a weasel.</font>

346
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,971
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone who just moves pieces
around a chess board for a living.</font>

347
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,963
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, guess what?
Yeah, yeah, I am.</font>

348
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,975
<font color=#FFFF5E>But that is how you
get 17 countries</font>

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,303
<font color=#FFFF5E>to agree to build
a space station.</font>

350
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:26,054
<font color=#FFFF5E>Now, you.
You build things.</font>

351
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,732
<font color=#FFFF5E>And there's something wrong
with the thing that you built.</font>

352
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,519
<font color=#FFFF5E>And people are dying.</font>

353
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,628
<font color=#FFFF5E>If you really think you're the best,
which I know that you do,</font>

354
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:38,497
<font color=#FFFF5E>then how the hell can you
stand there and say no?</font>

355
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,392
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll be taking orders
from someone, I suppose?</font>

356
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,095
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

357
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:48,529
<font color=#FFFF5E>So what, is that a yes?</font>

358
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,452
<font color=#FFFF5E>Long as it's not you.
Yeah.</font>

359
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,002
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Hey, this is Max.
Leave a message.</i></font>

360
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,416
<font color=#FFFF5E>You got any room in there for me?</font>

361
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,005
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay.</font>

362
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:33,734
<font color=#FFFF5E>I think this is everything.</font>

363
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:37,122
<font color=#FFFF5E>I made you a
packed lunch as well.</font>

364
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,825
<font color=#FFFF5E>Did you hear about the gas main
explosions in Hong Kong?</font>

365
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:41,658
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, it just hit the news.</font>

366
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,060
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's terrible.</font>

367
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,303
<font color=#FFFF5E>Was it anything like
what happened in Afghanistan?</font>

368
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:47,565
<font color=#FFFF5E>Nothing happened in Afghanistan.</font>

369
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,477
<font color=#FFFF5E>Are you going back up to space?</font>

370
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,481
<font color=#FFFF5E>- No.
- Yes, you are!</font>

371
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:54,423
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're leaving today
to fix Dutch Boy.</font>

372
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,176
<font color=#FFFF5E>What did I tell you
about eavesdropping?</font>

373
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:59,236
<font color=#FFFF5E>You never told me anything
about eavesdropping.</font>

374
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:01,082
<font color=#FFFF5E>You don't really
do much parenting.</font>

375
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,675
<font color=#FFFF5E>How do you know it's safe?</font>

376
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,116
<font color=#FFFF5E>Of course, it's safe. I've been
up there a hundred times.</font>

377
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,013
<font color=#FFFF5E>Don't treat me like I'm a child.
Someone died!</font>

378
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:12,453
<font color=#FFFF5E>- It was an accident.
- Someone got sucked out.</font>

379
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,721
<font color=#FFFF5E>It was an accident.</font>

380
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:16,812
<font color=#FFFF5E>See, that's what I'm going
up there to fix, okay?</font>

381
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,116
<font color=#FFFF5E>You don't have to worry.</font>

382
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,504
<font color=#FFFF5E>Think of it like I'm going on
a vacation for a week or two.</font>

383
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:26,256
<font color=#FFFF5E>To a place 250 miles straight up?</font>

384
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,812
<font color=#FFFF5E>And negative 450 degrees?</font>

385
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:30,213
<font color=#FFFF5E>Some holiday.</font>

386
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,641
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, you got a point.</font>

387
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,588
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why'd Uncle Max fire you?</font>

388
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,689
<font color=#FFFF5E>Unbelievable!</font>

389
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:38,771
<font color=#FFFF5E>Did you do something wrong?</font>

390
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,057
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, look, your Uncle Max
and me, it's...</font>

391
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:43,387
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's not just about the one job.</font>

392
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:47,513
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sometimes, younger brothers
resent being younger.</font>

393
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,813
<font color=#FFFF5E>So they get bossy.
They think they know everything.</font>

394
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,032
<font color=#FFFF5E>They tell you how to act,
how to talk, and...</font>

395
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:53,743
<font color=#FFFF5E>after a couple of decades, you</font>

396
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:55,064
<font color=#FFFF5E>just get tired of
listening to it.</font>

397
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,130
<font color=#FFFF5E>Maybe you should listen.</font>

398
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:03,409
<font color=#FFFF5E>My lift is here.</font>

399
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:04,709
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Gotta go.
- What?</font>

400
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:06,691
<font color=#FFFF5E>Wait, I thought I was
taking you to the airport?</font>

401
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:08,931
<font color=#FFFF5E>You really wanna
see Mom? Great.</font>

402
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,066
<font color=#FFFF5E>We can all fly home
to Atlanta together.</font>

403
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:12,860
<font color=#FFFF5E>I got it covered.</font>

404
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:14,680
<font color=#FFFF5E>Quit acting like you're mad.</font>

405
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,216
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hannah, what do you
want from me­?</font>

406
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,666
<font color=#FFFF5E>I want you to come back alive.</font>

407
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:23,264
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you're not exactly
the reliable type.</font>

408
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:28,856
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey.</font>

409
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:39,869
<font color=#FFFF5E>I know I haven't always made
good on my promises,</font>

410
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,815
<font color=#FFFF5E>but I'm coming back!</font>

411
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,512
<font color=#FFFF5E>- I...
- Promise.</font>

412
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,216
<font color=#FFFF5E>I promise.</font>

413
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:51,796
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come here.</font>

414
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,419
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll be back soon, okay?</font>

415
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,228
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>OV-104 is now at T-minus one hour,
and ready for boarding.</i></font>

416

one minute and counting.</i></font>

417
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,736

separation confirmed.</i></font>

422
00:29:48,823 --> 00:29:50,560
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look at you, girl.</font>

424

<font color=#FFFF5E>Mr. Lawson.</font>

425
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,753
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey.</font>

426
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:01,863
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ute Fassbinder.</font>

427
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,165
<font color=#FFFF5E>Nice to meet you.</font>

428
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,043
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I remember you.</font>

429
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:06,544
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, you were the
German scientist.</font>

430
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:07,766
<font color=#FFFF5E>You were here when I was here.</font>

431
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,259
<font color=#FFFF5E>Thermospherics, right?</font>

432
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,307
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yah.</font>

433
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:13,408
<font color=#FFFF5E>The containment shell needs
a fresh coat of sealant,</font>

434

the channel housing.</font>

435
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:18,167
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not good. That's wrong.</font>

436
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:19,565
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you hear that?</font>

437
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,065
<font color=#FFFF5E>- I'm sorry.
- Shh, listen.</font>

438
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:22,901
<font color=#FFFF5E>That one-way hum?</font>

439
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's a bad step down transformer.</font>

440
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:28,096
<font color=#FFFF5E>All these things, they have
to be watched, cared for.</font>

441
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,206
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Mr. Lawson.
- No, I know, I know it's not your fault.</font>

442
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,589
<font color=#FFFF5E>But when I left,
everything here was perfect.</font>

443
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,020
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, maybe I need to
speak to your chief scientist</font>

444
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:38,118
<font color=#FFFF5E>about the fine art of
giving a shit.</font>

445
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,350
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm the Chief Scientist.
I've been promoted a year ago.</font>

446
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:43,601
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, congratulations.</font>

447
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,448
<font color=#FFFF5E>One of our crew died
this week, Mr. Lawson.</font>

448
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,605
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sorry about the transformer.</font>

449
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,169
<font color=#FFFF5E>Let me introduce you to your team.</font>

450
00:30:58,143 --> 00:30:59,899
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, of course, an American.</font>

451
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,310
<font color=#FFFF5E>Actually, my brother and I were
born in the UK, but thank you.</font>

452
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,051
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, but you got
the old Stars and...</font>

453
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,603
<font color=#FFFF5E>Stripes on your arm there and...</font>

454
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:08,038
<font color=#FFFF5E>cowboy look in your eye.</font>

455
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:11,106
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, no offence,
it's just a serious situation and</font>

456
00:31:11,408 --> 00:31:12,782
<font color=#FFFF5E>the last thing we need is some</font>

457
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,336
<font color=#FFFF5E>Washington douche to come
supervise us, do we lads?</font>

458
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,499
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, you got one, so.</font>

459
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,860
<font color=#FFFF5E>How about we start with
names and positions.</font>

460
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,064
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mm-hmm.</font>

461
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,604
<font color=#FFFF5E>Adisa, structural.</font>

462
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:26,237
<font color=#FFFF5E>Duncan Taylor,
systems and OS analyst</font>

463
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:27,598
<font color=#FFFF5E>and loyal British subject.</font>

464
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,006
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hernandez, robotics.</font>

465
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,610
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dussette?</font>

466
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:36,613
<font color=#FFFF5E>Satcom and security.</font>

467
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,894
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you are?</font>

468
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,571
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is Mr. Jake Lawson.</font>

469
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,955
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're Jake Lawson?
<i>The</i> Jake Lawson?</font>

470
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:49,574
<font color=#FFFF5E>Y-You look much older
than I would've thought.</font>

471
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,579
<font color=#FFFF5E>I-I mean, you look good, but</font>

472
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,484
<font color=#FFFF5E>y-your physical appearance is not</font>

473
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:58,151
<font color=#FFFF5E>does not match the-the amount
of time that has elapsed</font>

474
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,667
<font color=#FFFF5E>in your life.</font>

475
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:03,409
<font color=#FFFF5E>Am I getting fired?</font>

476
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:07,816
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, we don't have a lot of time.</font>

477
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,942
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, we have three
situations to examine.</font>

478
00:32:11,143 --> 00:32:13,774
<font color=#FFFF5E>Afghanistan, the scientist
that died here,</font>

479
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:15,628
<font color=#FFFF5E>and the new incident in Hong Kong.</font>

480
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:18,327
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hong Kong? No, that was
that was a gas main explosion.</font>

481
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:19,930
<font color=#FFFF5E>We all watched that on the telly.</font>

482
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:22,184
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, okay, you
just keep believing that.</font>

483
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,075
<font color=#FFFF5E>I, on the other hand,
have a mystery</font>

484
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,783
<font color=#FFFF5E>that I'd like to solve
and prevent more deaths, so.</font>

485
00:32:27,983 --> 00:32:29,805
<font color=#FFFF5E>Feel free to join me.</font>

486
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,807
<font color=#FFFF5E>Or not.</font>

487
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:40,666
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, quick question.</font>

488
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,668
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, active shooter.</font>

489
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,414
<font color=#FFFF5E>The President and I
are both in the line of fire.</font>

490
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:47,328
<font color=#FFFF5E>Who do you save first?
Me...</font>

491
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,530
<font color=#FFFF5E>The President.</font>

492
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:51,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, you could take a second
just to think about that.</font>

493
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,496
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sorry, baby.</font>

494
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,969
<font color=#FFFF5E>Job comes first.
Same with you.</font>

495
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,640
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, that's not true.</font>

496
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,574
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, I have priorities,
and you...</font>

497
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,793
<font color=#FFFF5E>you are my priority.</font>

498
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:02,127
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, let's do it.</font>

499
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,380
<font color=#FFFF5E>I kinda want to, but um...</font>

500
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,185
<font color=#FFFF5E>you just keep talkin'.</font>

501
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:09,696
<font color=#FFFF5E>And why do we always
have to be sneakin' around?</font>

502
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, let's do it.
Let's get married.</font>

503
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,257
<font color=#FFFF5E>We can't.</font>

504
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,180
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's against the rules.</font>

505
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:20,572
<font color=#FFFF5E>One day, baby.</font>

506
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,928
<font color=#FFFF5E>Um, you're gonna get that.</font>

507
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,825
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because your job comes first.</font>

508
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:33,127
<font color=#FFFF5E>No...</font>

509
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:37,095
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm gonna get it 'cause I don't
want it to interfere with this.</font>

510
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:39,354
<font color=#FFFF5E>See?</font>

511
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,773
<font color=#FFFF5E>Now, I might just <i>not</i> save you.</font>

512
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,043
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, hello?</font>

513
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,330
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max, it's Cheng.</font>

514
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:48,385
<font color=#FFFF5E>Cheng, God,
tell me you're not in Hong Kong.</font>

515
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:49,787
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Cheng?
<i>- Last night...</i></font>

516
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,988
<font color=#FFFF5E>I was right in the middle of it.
It was horrible.</font>

517
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:53,326
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's why I'm calling.</font>

518
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,767
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Phone service just came back on.</i></font>

519
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,321
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, well, you're lucky to be alive.</font>

520
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:57,435
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I mean those gas pipes?</i></font>

521
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,040
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not so sure
that was the cause.</font>

522
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,865
<font color=#FFFF5E>What you you mean?
I-I don't follow.</font>

523
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:04,268
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>It was abnormally hot
before the pipes blew.</i></font>

524
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
<font color=#FFFF5E>The satellite sensors
should've recorded it, right?</font>

525
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:07,931
<font color=#FFFF5E>I checked over a dozen times</font>

526
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:10,293
<font color=#FFFF5E>but I can't get access to
Dutch Boy's Hong Kong satellite.</font>

527
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:11,394
<font color=#FFFF5E>My access has been blocked.</font>

528
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:12,992
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Check your holoframe.</i></font>

529
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:15,524
<font color=#FFFF5E>I don't understand.
We both have clearance.</font>

530
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,636
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Exactly.</i></font>

531
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,757
<font color=#FFFF5E>And the only people that
have the authority to block it</font>

532
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,038
<font color=#FFFF5E>are in the building you work in.</font>

533
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:22,994
<font color=#FFFF5E>Wait.
What do you mean?</font>

534
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,543
<font color=#FFFF5E>If someone is covering up
a system defect,</font>

535
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>there's potential for critical
failure on a global scale.</font>

536
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,274
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>If Dutch Boy has
a catastrophic failure,</i></font>

537
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:31,807
<font color=#FFFF5E>it can create
something far worse</font>

538
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,229
<font color=#FFFF5E>than what we're
trying to prevent.</font>

539
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:34,550
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>What we call a geostorm.</i></font>

540
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:38,156
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, what, slow down, Cheng.
All right? A what?</font>

541
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,628
<font color=#FFFF5E>A geostorm.</font>

542
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,331
<font color=#FFFF5E>Simultaneous
catastrophic weather</font>

543
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:43,018
<font color=#FFFF5E>events triggered all
over the globe.</font>

544
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:45,222
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Once they pass
the minimum threshold,</i></font>

545
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:46,977
<font color=#FFFF5E>the storms will start
causing new storms.</font>

546
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,641
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Like a chain reaction
until they merge together.</i></font>

547
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,236
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's gotta be a glitch.</font>

548
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:53,217
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I'll give you a call
when I know something.</i></font>

549
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,586
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right. Thanks.</font>

550
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:03,540
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>These pipes have not been
well-maintained or upgraded in years.</i></font>

551
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:07,850
<font color=#FFFF5E>Cheng thinks Hong Kong had
something to do with Dutch Boy.</font>

552
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,415
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's implying some kind of cover-up.</font>

553
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:13,530
<font color=#FFFF5E>I just got a text and POTUS
called a last-minute press briefing.</font>

554
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,490
<font color=#FFFF5E>What, you can't stay?</font>

555
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,508
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, when duty calls, duty calls.</font>

556
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,398
<font color=#FFFF5E>"Neither rain nor snow
nor gloom of night", right.</font>

557
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,333
<font color=#FFFF5E>Honey, that's the Postal Service.</font>

558
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:25,234
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're the <i>Secret</i> Service.
Secret Service.</font>

559
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,375
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, there's a difference?
Really?</font>

560
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:30,307
<font color=#FFFF5E>I didn't know that.</font>

561
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,734
<font color=#FFFF5E>Grab his laptop.
Let's go.</font>

562
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,020
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, the satellite that
went rogue over Afghanistan,</font>

563
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:23,196
<font color=#FFFF5E>what type was that?</font>

564
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:27,425
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's my fave, actually.
I call it a "RocknRolla".</font>

565
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:30,150
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ah, the SR-22.</font>

566
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,715
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uses sonic waves to
slow molecular movement</font>

567
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:34,152
<font color=#FFFF5E>causing cooling.</font>

568
00:36:34,353 --> 00:36:36,649
<font color=#FFFF5E>But in that case,
freezing. Why?</font>

569
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,150
<font color=#FFFF5E>We don't know. We checked
the satellite's hard drives</font>

570
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,533
<font color=#FFFF5E>but the logs were wiped clean
by the malfunction.</font>

571
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:44,774
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right. Let's pull up every
RocknRolla satellite we have</font>

572
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:47,895
<font color=#FFFF5E>to see if we can find
any corruption in their logs.</font>

573
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,097
<font color=#FFFF5E>Pull up every
RocknRolla in the net.</font>

574
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,590
<font color=#FFFF5E>There's gotta be more
than a thousand of them.</font>

575
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:55,153
<font color=#FFFF5E>Ah, 1,270, to be exact.</font>

576
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,934
<font color=#FFFF5E>And we're gonna scan
each and every one of them.</font>

577
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,546
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dana. Hey.</font>

578
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:11,378
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, what are you doing here?</font>

579
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,090
<font color=#FFFF5E>What do you mean,
what am I doing here? I...</font>

580
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:15,466
<font color=#FFFF5E>I work here.
I'm your boss.</font>

581
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,648
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, but what are you
doing down from Mt. Olympus</font>

582
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:19,488
<font color=#FFFF5E>and visiting me in Millennial Village?</font>

583
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,395
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, I have
I have a favor to ask you.</font>

584
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:25,457
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're the best at what you do.</font>

585
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:27,407
<font color=#FFFF5E>I need you to
keep this between us.</font>

586
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,498
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay.</font>

587
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:32,973
<font color=#FFFF5E>I have a problem
with my holoframe.</font>

588
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,827
<font color=#FFFF5E>Do I look like a
Genius Bar to you?</font>

589
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:37,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm sorry. I'm sitting here
defending the free world</font>

590
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,068
<font color=#FFFF5E>against state operators
and cyber terrorists</font>

591
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,087
<font color=#FFFF5E>but grandpa needs
a fix in his phone.</font>

592
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:43,890
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, but I have a
problem trying to</font>

593
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:46,424
<font color=#FFFF5E>get through to satellite
G-22 over Hong Kong.</font>

594
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:48,354
<font color=#FFFF5E>So a satellite has
a bad com, that happens.</font>

595
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,289
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, no not <i>a</i> satellite.</font>

596
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:54,158
<font color=#FFFF5E>All of them.</font>

597
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,530
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh.</font>

598
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,023
<font color=#FFFF5E>I am mildly intrigued.
Stay.</font>

599
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,758
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay.</font>

600
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:11,985
<font color=#FFFF5E>Looks like Vanilla
line disruption...</font>

601
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:15,165
<font color=#FFFF5E>bad server relay or
trunc failure or something.</font>

602
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:17,511
<font color=#FFFF5E>You still dating that
Secret Service chick?</font>

603
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,660
<font color=#FFFF5E>What? No.</font>

604
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:22,873
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, I'm not dating anyone.</font>

605
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,917
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mm-hmm.</font>

606
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:28,907
<font color=#FFFF5E>Wait, look. Oh, my God.</font>

607
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:31,308
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone wanted to block
your access without you</font>

608
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,240
<font color=#FFFF5E>knowing that it was intentional.</font>

609
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:34,997
<font color=#FFFF5E>But this...</font>

610
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,082
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is very intentional,
and it's very clever.</font>

611
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:40,801
<font color=#FFFF5E>And I know
what you're gonna say.</font>

612
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,930
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're gonna say, 'tell no one',
and I won't.</font>

613
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:45,990
<font color=#FFFF5E>But I didn't sign up to work here
so I could cubicle squat 24-7.</font>

614
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,072
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, whatever is going on,
I want in on the action.</font>

615
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,723
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, then let's hope
there isn't any action.</font>

616
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,640
<font color=#FFFF5E>And yeah...</font>

617
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,721
<font color=#FFFF5E>Tell no one.</font>

618
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,756
<font color=#FFFF5E>Miss Fassbinder,</font>

619
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,597
<font color=#FFFF5E>we've just been given a
priority communication request.</font>

620
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:05,966
<font color=#FFFF5E>From Climate Command?</font>

621
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,261
<font color=#FFFF5E>From the White House.</font>

622
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,089
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right so, who are the
yahoos in Washington</font>

623
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,071
<font color=#FFFF5E>we're gonna deal with on this?</font>

624
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,881
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I guess I would be
the head yahoo.</i></font>

625
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:27,689
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hello, guys.</font>

626
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,295
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Max tells me you don't have
a high opinion of politicians</i></font>

627
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,097
<font color=#FFFF5E>I didn't say... that.</font>

628
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,439
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Well, neither do I.</i></font>

629
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,170
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We went through hell
getting the world</i></font>

630
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,874
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>on board with this program.</i></font>

631
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,276
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We've come too far
for it to fail.</i></font>

632
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:44,098
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>You and I both understand
why we cannot let that happen.</i></font>

633
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,400
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, sir.</font>

634
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:48,191
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, if I find anything,
I'll report to you right away.</font>

635
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,010
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Actually, you'll be
reporting to Max here.</i></font>

636
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,375
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Good luck.</i></font>

637
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,317
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Have at it.</i></font>

638
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,150
<font color=#FFFF5E>Thank you, sir.</font>

639
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:01,565
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll leave you two alone. If you
need me, I'll be in my office.</font>

640
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,444
<font color=#FFFF5E>Thank you.</font>

641
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,083
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll be reporting to you?</font>

642
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:08,411
<font color=#FFFF5E>You lied to me.</font>

643
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:09,913
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Again.</i></font>

644
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:13,133
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, I just didn't answer
your ridiculous demand.</font>

645
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>How do I switch this thing off?</font>

646
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,979
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>There's something you need to know.</i></font>

647
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,183
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We've been having
issues down here</i></font>

648
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,152
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>accessing the Dutch Boy satcom.</i></font>

649
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,919
<font color=#FFFF5E>We have reason to believe that...</font>

650
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,092
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, it may not be accidental.</font>

651
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,236
<font color=#FFFF5E>Might not be accidental?</font>

652
00:40:29,436 --> 00:40:32,099
<font color=#FFFF5E>I've been trying to access
the Hong Kong satellite.</font>

653
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,548
<font color=#FFFF5E>I knew it.</font>

654
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,288
<font color=#FFFF5E>I knew it!</font>

655
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,689
<font color=#FFFF5E>You think it's possible?</font>

656
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,092
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, it's possible.</font>

657
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:42,600
<font color=#FFFF5E>But even if you could access
the Hong Kong satellite remotely,</font>

658
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:44,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>you're not gonna
get the logs you need.</font>

659
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:46,831
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. We gotta pull
that information</font>

660
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:48,721
<font color=#FFFF5E>from the actual
satellite up here.</font>

661
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,014
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, I can authorize that.</font>

662
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:53,596
<font color=#FFFF5E>I don't need your
authorization for anything.</font>

663
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:55,842
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm sure that's
really scary for you.</font>

664
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:57,890
<font color=#FFFF5E>But how about
you just count on me</font>

665
00:40:57,994 --> 00:40:59,824
<font color=#FFFF5E>to do my job
and say 'thank you'?</font>

666
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:01,427
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, count on you.</font>

667
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,784
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Remember the first time
I had to bail you out?</i></font>

668
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:05,886
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, God, Jesus Christ.</font>

669
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:08,433
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, just one week
after Mom and Dad died,</font>

670
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:10,216
<font color=#FFFF5E>you got arrested
for fighting, hmm?</font>

671
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,939
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>That's when I
realized that despite</i></font>

672
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:13,338
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>everything I was going through,</i></font>

673
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,506
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I was gonna have to be
responsible for you.</i></font>

674
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,112
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, you know what?
Fine. It is what it is.</font>

675
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:22,624
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I guess I got no choice
but to count on you.</i></font>

676
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:25,756
<font color=#FFFF5E>But if you ever authorize
anything without my approval,</font>

677
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,956
<font color=#FFFF5E>you're gonna be on
the next shuttle home.</font>

678
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:36,465
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Transmission ended.</i></font>

679
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:44,112
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Hong Kong satellite 022
inbound for examination.</i></font>

680
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,420
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right.</font>

681
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,545
<font color=#FFFF5E>Let's take this thing apart,</font>

682
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:53,979
<font color=#FFFF5E>find out what
happened in Hong Kong.</font>

683
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,482
<font color=#FFFF5E>Bring it down.</font>

684
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:58,619
<font color=#FFFF5E>It should've come down by now.</font>

685
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:01,846
<font color=#FFFF5E>What is that?</font>

686
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,388
<font color=#FFFF5E>I have no idea.</font>

687
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:08,155
<font color=#FFFF5E>- All right, shut it down.
- It's not responding.</font>

688
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,357
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jesus, Hernandez!</font>

689
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:11,035
<font color=#FFFF5E>Get down!</font>

690
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,570
<font color=#FFFF5E>Get outta here! Go!</font>

691
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:19,912
<font color=#FFFF5E>Somebody, open this door now!</font>

692
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,034
<font color=#FFFF5E>Watch out!</font>

693
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:25,295
<font color=#FFFF5E>Shit!</font>

694
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:46,521
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'd like to pick up every
single piece of this thing</font>

695
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:49,075
<font color=#FFFF5E>and get it down to manufacturing.</font>

696
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,012
<font color=#FFFF5E>Think we can retrieve the logs
from the hard drives?</font>

697
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:08,810
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, the accident
created an electrical</font>

698
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:10,132
<font color=#FFFF5E>short and fried all the drives.</font>

699
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,035
<font color=#FFFF5E>I mean, look at it.
It's toast.</font>

700
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,788
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, we've lost all the drives
with possible corruption?</font>

701
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:16,689
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not all of them.</font>

702
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:18,558
<font color=#FFFF5E>What do you mean?</font>

703
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,671
<font color=#FFFF5E>I was reviewing a video from the
accident that killed Makmoud.</font>

704
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:28,293
<font color=#FFFF5E>Each of the panels that blew
has a drive inside.</font>

705
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:34,337
<font color=#FFFF5E>And one of them got stuck
in the communication tower.</font>

706
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:42,686
<font color=#FFFF5E>Looks like the seal locks
are still intact.</font>

707
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:46,563
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're lucky. The corrupted
drive could still be inside.</font>

708
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,917
<font color=#FFFF5E>We gotta get that panel back.</font>

709
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:54,351
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, hello?</font>

710
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:57,015
<font color=#FFFF5E>I just got into D.C.
We have to meet.</font>

711
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:58,417
<font color=#FFFF5E>I figured it all out.</font>

712
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:00,220
<font color=#FFFF5E>Meet me at 10:00</font>

713
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:02,251
<font color=#FFFF5E>at the place across the square
where we used to have lunch</font>

714
00:44:02,252 --> 00:44:03,353
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>back in college.</i></font>

715
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,768
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, yeah.
I'll be there.</font>

716
00:44:08,504 --> 00:44:09,915
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Ready to decompress.</i></font>

717
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:20,894
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right. Doors open, kids.</font>

718
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,796
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're clear to exit.</font>

719
00:44:23,768 --> 00:44:26,548
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Step across the gravity threshold
and follow me.</i></font>

see what's on those drives.</i></font>

721
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:34,289
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay.</font>

722
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:48,512
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>There's the panel.</i></font>

723
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:56,765
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Wait. Hold up.</i></font>

724
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,768
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We designed the tower to have
the emergency derig ports</i></font>

725
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,067

726
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,899

727
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,100
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Roger that.</i></font>

728
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:20,157
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come back now, kids, come back.</font>

729
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,631
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We're on our way back.</i></font>

730
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,492
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Jake, what's happening?</i></font>

731
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,743
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I don't know!</i></font>

732
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,442
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Jake? Jake!</i></font>

733
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,917
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I can't control that damn suit!</i></font>

734
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:45,475
<font color=#FFFF5E>- What's going on? What's going on?
- His suit's malfunctioning.</font>

735
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,638
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Jake, do you read me?
- Duncan, tell him to cut it.</font>

736
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,585
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jake, cut off the fuel intake.</font>

737
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,235
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>It's not responding!</i></font>

738
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:05,028
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Hang on, Jake.</i></font>

739
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:11,019
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I can't hold it!</i></font>

740
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,316
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Eject the pack.</i></font>

741
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,895
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Eject the pack!</i></font>

742
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,277
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, Christ, we're gonna lose him!</font>

743
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:29,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're gonna lose him!</font>

744
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:48,481
<font color=#FFFF5E>Are you all right?</font>

745
00:46:49,624 --> 00:46:50,624
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

746
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,340
<font color=#FFFF5E>You got the drive?</font>

747
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,051
<font color=#FFFF5E>I grabbed it
when I freed the panel.</font>

748
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:05,912
<font color=#FFFF5E>You smashed up a dozen
comlinks, TCAS sensors...</font>

749
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,738
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm fine. Thank you very much.</font>

750
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,271
<font color=#FFFF5E>What happened out there?</font>

751
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:12,751
<font color=#FFFF5E>Propulsion throttle locked up.</font>

752
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:14,845
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you lost the door panel
which means</font>

753
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,444
<font color=#FFFF5E>no drive codes.</font>

754
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,265
<font color=#FFFF5E>Back to square one.</font>

755
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,724
<font color=#FFFF5E>Great.</font>

756
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,166
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why didn't you tell them
about the drive?</font>

757
00:47:26,368 --> 00:47:28,507
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because someone
just tried to kill me.</font>

758
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:30,207
<font color=#FFFF5E>I know my crew.
I trust them.</font>

759
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,070
<font color=#FFFF5E>You <i>think</i> you know them.</font>

760
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:34,782
<font color=#FFFF5E>But someone doesn't want us
to see what's on this drive.</font>

761
00:47:36,727 --> 00:47:38,820
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jake, there's
no corruption here at all.</font>

762
00:47:38,977 --> 00:47:40,851
<font color=#FFFF5E>The doors weren't
accidentally blown off.</font>

763
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,006
<font color=#FFFF5E>They were programmed to.</font>

764
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:43,657
<font color=#FFFF5E>- This wasn't a malfunction.
- No.</font>

765
00:47:43,758 --> 00:47:46,256
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone intentionally killed Makmoud.</font>

766
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,020
<font color=#FFFF5E>No doubt the same person</font>

767
00:47:48,124 --> 00:47:49,968
<font color=#FFFF5E>that tampered with
the Hong Kong satellite.</font>

768
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:52,375
<font color=#FFFF5E>The user log ins
have been wiped clean.</font>

769
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,378
<font color=#FFFF5E>We have no digital fingerprints.</font>

770
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,760
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. That's what they think.</font>

771
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:01,342
<font color=#FFFF5E>Log in records are synched
back to the mainframe.</font>

772
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:02,703
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, but that's the problem.</font>

773
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,154
<font color=#FFFF5E>If they're deleted in one place,
they're deleted everywhere.</font>

774
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:06,403
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, everywhere they know about.</font>

775
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:09,468
<font color=#FFFF5E>When we built Dutch Boy,
we put in a-a locked off library.</font>

776
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:12,299
<font color=#FFFF5E>Something that would track
and archive everything.</font>

777
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,678
<font color=#FFFF5E>Our saboteur's log in info
is gonna be in there.</font>

778
00:48:19,818 --> 00:48:20,818
<font color=#FFFF5E>No.</font>

779
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:23,105
<font color=#FFFF5E>You've been locked out.</font>

780
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:27,251
<font color=#FFFF5E>But by who?</font>

781
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:35,047
<font color=#FFFF5E>The virtual conference room.</font>

782
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:37,341
<font color=#FFFF5E>How many have access
to those transmissions?</font>

783
00:48:37,613 --> 00:48:39,799
<font color=#FFFF5E>Anyone with level three access
and above.</font>

784
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:42,061
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dozens of people.</font>

785
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:46,201
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max.</font>

786
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:48,650
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Max.
- What?</font>

787
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:51,724
<font color=#FFFF5E>Relax.
He'll be here soon.</font>

788
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:53,709
<font color=#FFFF5E>What, really? I-I seem nervous?</font>

789
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,391
<font color=#FFFF5E>Just a little.</font>

790
00:48:58,465 --> 00:48:59,711
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's here.</font>

791
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:01,180
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's here?</font>

792
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:13,208
<font color=#FFFF5E>No! No!</font>

793
00:49:13,508 --> 00:49:15,069
<font color=#FFFF5E>Cheng! Oh, God!</font>

794
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:16,071
<font color=#FFFF5E>No!</font>

795
00:49:16,272 --> 00:49:17,545
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is Agent Wilson.</font>

796
00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:19,281
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes, I need an
ambulance right now!</font>

797
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:20,721
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Dupont Circle.
- Max...</font>

798
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,642
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Agent Wilson,
I'm dispatching the ambulance.</i></font>

799
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,093
<font color=#FFFF5E>You got me. You got me.</font>

800
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,060
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm here, look at me.
Look at me.</font>

801
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:42,858
<font color=#FFFF5E>Zeus...</font>

802
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:44,496
<font color=#FFFF5E>Z-Zeus...</font>

803
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:45,996
<font color=#FFFF5E>What?</font>

804
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,371
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Virtual conference initiating.</i></font>

805
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:01,367
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max? You okay?</font>

806
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,626
<font color=#FFFF5E>They said it was urgent.
What is it?</font>

807
00:50:04,028 --> 00:50:05,455
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, uh.</font>

808
00:50:06,448 --> 00:50:09,713
<font color=#FFFF5E>I wanted to... apologize.</font>

809
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,215
<font color=#FFFF5E>Apologize?</font>

810
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:15,860
<font color=#FFFF5E>If you had any idea
what I just walked away from...</font>

811
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:18,646
<font color=#FFFF5E>You gotta drag me up here
just to apologize?</font>

812
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:21,695
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>All right, fine.</i></font>

813
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,197
<font color=#FFFF5E>Apology accepted.</font>

814
00:50:23,298 --> 00:50:25,533
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, Max, we don't walk out
on each other.</font>

815
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,037
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's the unspoken code
between brothers.</font>

00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,878
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i></font>

817
00:50:42,078 --> 00:50:44,853
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, he dropped his
cellphone in Key Biscayne.</font>

818
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:49,793
<font color=#FFFF5E>Proof the Lawsons aren't fishermen.</font>

819
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,416
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Four hours...</i></font>

820
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,502

821
00:50:56,404 --> 00:51:00,394
<font color=#FFFF5E>I tried to sabotage Dad's reel
so we could leave.</font>

822
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,840
<font color=#FFFF5E>That pin, the highest
part of the spool,</font>

823
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,137
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>pulled it, so the level
mechanism would pop out.</i></font>

824
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,036
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Of course, Dad was a government</i></font>

Caught me red-handed.</font>

826
00:51:15,546 --> 00:51:18,061
<font color=#FFFF5E>"Trust me," he said.
I get it.</font>

827
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:20,269

830
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:33,349
<font color=#FFFF5E>I didn't even understand
what he meant back then.</font>

831
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:37,852
<font color=#FFFF5E>But I do now.</font>

832
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:40,864
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Take care, Max.</i></font>

833
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:43,551

835
00:51:50,371 --> 00:51:51,475
<font color=#FFFF5E>What was all that?</font>

836
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:56,505
<font color=#FFFF5E>That was the first decent
conversation we've had in years.</font>

837
00:52:07,902 --> 00:52:09,114
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh! Oh, my God!</font>

838
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:10,805
<font color=#FFFF5E>Would you relax?</font>

839
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,875
<font color=#FFFF5E>What?</font>

840
00:52:12,277 --> 00:52:13,417
<font color=#FFFF5E>Do you have a moment?</font>

841
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:15,399
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes! I do, I got your message.</font>

842
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:16,541
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jesus.</font>

843
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,820
<font color=#FFFF5E>What happened?
Did Secret Service Barbie dump you?</font>

844
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:21,702
<font color=#FFFF5E>I-I need to show you something.</font>

845
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:24,865
<font color=#FFFF5E>Take a look at this.</font>

<font color=#FFFF5E>Our dad never took us fishing.</font>

849
00:52:38,414 --> 00:52:39,797
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh.</font>

850
00:52:40,915 --> 00:52:41,917
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's sad.</font>

851
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:45,310
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

852
00:52:45,511 --> 00:52:47,786
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not good at the, like,

854
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:52,185
<font color=#FFFF5E>What? No.
No, no, no.</font>

855
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:53,757
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's a code.</font>

856
00:52:56,186 --> 00:52:58,690
<font color=#FFFF5E>"He dropped his cellphone
in Key Biscayne".</font>

857
00:52:59,491 --> 00:53:01,191
<font color=#FFFF5E>His cellphone number is the key.</font>

858
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:04,776
<font color=#FFFF5E>Take a look at the digits.</font>

859
00:53:04,977 --> 00:53:07,655
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, you got your first number,
that's your first word.</font>

860
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:10,095
<font color=#FFFF5E>Second number, nine.
You move on nine words.</font>

861
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:10,998
<font color=#FFFF5E>- That's your second word.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

862
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:12,304
<font color=#FFFF5E>Third number, nine again.</font>

863
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:13,950
<font color=#FFFF5E>Another nine, you move on.</font>

864
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,253
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then nine, then two, then nine,
then five, so on, and so on,</font>

865
00:53:16,254 --> 00:53:18,323
<font color=#FFFF5E>until you get an entirely
different message.</font>

866
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:21,220
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, who came up with
this encryption, a 12-year-old?</font>

867
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,424
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. I was 13.</font>

868
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,779
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay.</font>

869
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,129
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, one, nine, nine, nine,</font>

870
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,395
<font color=#FFFF5E>two, nine, five,</font>

871
00:53:32,496 --> 00:53:35,386
<font color=#FFFF5E>five, eight, seven, one. And go.</font>

872
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:41,365
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Proof of sabotage at the
highest level of government.</i></font>

873
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:42,960
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Trust no one.</i></font>

874
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:51,010
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, you said you were
looking for action.</font>

875
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:55,354
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, but I mean, holy shit.</font>

876
00:53:57,006 --> 00:53:59,166
<font color=#FFFF5E>If you don't wanna take
this any further, I understand.</font>

877
00:53:59,304 --> 00:54:01,439
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, no, no, no.
I do, I do. It's just...</font>

878
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:05,053
<font color=#FFFF5E>I do and I don't.</font>

879
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:08,131
<font color=#FFFF5E>Kinda like going on a roller coaster
or eating Chipotle.</font>

880
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:11,462
<font color=#FFFF5E>What's our next move?</font>

881
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:13,905
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, I need you to find
anything you can</font>

882
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,841
<font color=#FFFF5E>on a file named Project Zeus.</font>

883
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:19,592
<font color=#FFFF5E>Project Zeus?</font>

884
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:20,793
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

885
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:24,581
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay. Looks like we have
ourselves a bro-spicacy here.</font>

886
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:26,560
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, just run the damn search.</font>

887
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,503
<font color=#FFFF5E>Um...</font>

888
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:30,327
<font color=#FFFF5E>I am getting a hit.</font>

889
00:54:30,431 --> 00:54:31,331
<font color=#FFFF5E>Um...</font>

890
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:33,796
<font color=#FFFF5E>Looks like it's double-encrypted.
It's a little OCD.</font>

891
00:54:34,198 --> 00:54:35,304
<font color=#FFFF5E>C-Can you break it?</font>

892
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,094
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I could but...</font>

893
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:40,114
<font color=#FFFF5E>I can't do it from here.</font>

894
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:41,719
<font color=#FFFF5E>File's under a White
House security</font>

895
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,080
<font color=#FFFF5E>network and it's
just not hackable.</font>

896
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,319
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'd have to log in and
I don't have the credentials for it.</font>

897
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,954
<font color=#FFFF5E>Shit. Nor do I.</font>

898
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,184
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, I-I don't know anyone who does.</font>

899
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:53,229
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, you do.</font>

900
00:55:03,317 --> 00:55:04,658
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max?</font>

901
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:19,297
<font color=#FFFF5E>Freeze.</font>

902
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,631
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh! Holy shit!</font>

903
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:22,657
<font color=#FFFF5E>Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey, relax!</font>

904
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,369
<font color=#FFFF5E>Who is this girl in our house?</font>

905
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,943
<font color=#FFFF5E>I-I can explain everything.</font>

906
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:28,890
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uhmm, that sounds really pervy.</font>

907
00:55:29,038 --> 00:55:30,463
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Shut up.
- Okay, I'm sorry, I will.</font>

908
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:33,987
<font color=#FFFF5E>I broke one of your wine glasses.
Um, i-it just fell and</font>

909
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:35,623
<font color=#FFFF5E>I promise I'm gonna reimburse you.</font>

910
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:37,635
<font color=#FFFF5E>Um, I have the money, I'm sorry.</font>

911
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:38,836
<font color=#FFFF5E>Talk.</font>

912
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:41,781
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is Dana.
She works with me in State.</font>

913
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:44,261
<font color=#FFFF5E>Now I asked her here
'cause I need her help.</font>

914
00:55:44,462 --> 00:55:47,378
<font color=#FFFF5E>And uh, well, as it turns out,
I need your help too.</font>

915
00:55:48,757 --> 00:55:49,757
<font color=#FFFF5E>She's hot!</font>

916
00:55:52,846 --> 00:55:54,903
<font color=#FFFF5E>I know how much
your job means to you.</font>

917
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:56,237
<font color=#FFFF5E>I took an oath, Max.</font>

918
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:57,999
<font color=#FFFF5E>We have rules.</font>

919
00:55:58,301 --> 00:55:59,211
<font color=#FFFF5E>And technically,
you're not supposed</font>

920
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:00,070
<font color=#FFFF5E>to be sleeping together, either.</font>

921
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:01,238
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dana.</font>

922
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:03,437
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're asking me
to commit a crime.</font>

923
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're soliciting a Secret
Service agent</font>

924
00:56:06,394 --> 00:56:08,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>to break into the
White House server</font>

925
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:09,943
<font color=#FFFF5E>and illegally obtain files.</font>

926
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:12,007
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you thought I would say yes!</font>

927
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,808
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I still think
you're gonna say yes.</font>

928
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:14,614
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why?</font>

929
00:56:14,689 --> 00:56:16,408
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because I'm the one
who's asking you.</font>

930
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:18,545
<font color=#FFFF5E>You know, and if I'm asking you,</font>

931
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:20,889
<font color=#FFFF5E>well, then it must be important.</font>

932
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,723
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you know that
it's bigger than you and me.</font>

933
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:24,924
<font color=#FFFF5E>You and I.</font>

934
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:26,126
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Shut up.
- Shut up.</font>

935
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,718
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sarah, please.</font>

936
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,867
<font color=#FFFF5E>One time.</font>

937
00:56:36,968 --> 00:56:39,235
<font color=#FFFF5E>We need to play back
the security cameras</font>

938
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:41,190
<font color=#FFFF5E>without alerting anyone.</font>

939
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:42,976
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone killed Makmoud.</font>

940
00:56:43,077 --> 00:56:45,142
<font color=#FFFF5E>We find out why,
we'll know who's behind this.</font>

941
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:48,073
<font color=#FFFF5E>But you can't access the cameras
without being logged in.</font>

942
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:50,148
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's why we're going
to the backup server room.</font>

943
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:53,795
<font color=#FFFF5E>See? It comes in handy
that I built the place.</font>

944
00:56:55,816 --> 00:56:58,864
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yes. But I live here.</font>

945
00:57:07,155 --> 00:57:08,155
<font color=#FFFF5E>Show-off.</font>

946
00:57:15,012 --> 00:57:17,236
<font color=#FFFF5E>Makmoud was prepping diagnostics
on the Afghan sat</font>

947
00:57:17,436 --> 00:57:18,999
<font color=#FFFF5E>while we launched a replacement.</font>

948
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,170
<font color=#FFFF5E>Son of a bitch.</font>

949
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:27,356
<font color=#FFFF5E>He pulled something off the sat.</font>

950
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:29,380
<font color=#FFFF5E>Poor bastard figured it out</font>

951
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,324
<font color=#FFFF5E>and they killed him
to make sure no one else did.</font>

952
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:34,997
<font color=#FFFF5E>There are no cameras
allowed in the locker rooms.</font>

953
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:39,369
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then let's go
take a look for ourselves.</font>

954
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:51,347
<font color=#FFFF5E>181.</font>

955
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:54,608
<font color=#FFFF5E>181.</font>

956
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:56,964
<font color=#FFFF5E>What's the code?</font>

957
00:57:58,336 --> 00:58:00,192
<font color=#FFFF5E>Seven, six, three, six, three.</font>

958
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:10,537
<font color=#FFFF5E>What do you think you're doing?</font>

959
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,921
<font color=#FFFF5E>You know what happened to me
out there wasn't an accident.</font>

960
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:19,896
<font color=#FFFF5E>Whoever did that...</font>

961
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,497
<font color=#FFFF5E>killed Makmoud.</font>

962
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:23,937
<font color=#FFFF5E>And what makes
you think it is not me?</font>

963
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:26,637
<font color=#FFFF5E>'Cause if it was you,
I'd be dead already.</font>

964
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:30,733
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dussette, lower your gun.</font>

965
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:35,276
<font color=#FFFF5E>Whatever you're looking for</font>

966
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:36,719
<font color=#FFFF5E>it is not in this locker.</font>

967
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:39,877
<font color=#FFFF5E>I was here when Makmoud came in.</font>

968
00:58:40,178 --> 00:58:41,938
<font color=#FFFF5E>He put his stuff
in an empty one.</font>

969
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:44,387
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why didn't you tell me?</font>

970
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,227
<font color=#FFFF5E>You watched the same
security footage that I did.</font>

971
00:58:47,428 --> 00:58:48,478
<font color=#FFFF5E>I was just waiting to see</font>

972
00:58:48,582 --> 00:58:50,462
<font color=#FFFF5E>who's gonna come and
look for Makmoud's stuff.</font>

973
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,278
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's in here.</font>

974
00:58:55,805 --> 00:58:57,061
<font color=#FFFF5E>Two, six, six, five, three.</font>

975
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:09,473
<font color=#FFFF5E>Bingo.</font>

976
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:11,990
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is everything he copied off</font>

977
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,669
<font color=#FFFF5E>the satellite onto
his holoframe.</font>

978
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,085
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's a virus.</font>

979
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:20,529
<font color=#FFFF5E>That wasn't generated by the
satellite's onboard computer.</font>

980
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:22,370
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because they were planted.</font>

981
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:25,703
<font color=#FFFF5E>Makmoud found the virus,
got killed before he could tell anyone.</font>

982
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:28,491
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, I got it.
All right, here we go.</font>

983
00:59:30,294 --> 00:59:31,294
<font color=#FFFF5E>Project Zeus.</font>

984
00:59:32,982 --> 00:59:35,345
<font color=#FFFF5E>There are tens of thousands
of storm simulations in here</font>

985
00:59:35,546 --> 00:59:37,346
<font color=#FFFF5E>and each one is
starting in a different place.</font>

986
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,324
<font color=#FFFF5E>They all end the same way.</font>

987
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,195
<font color=#FFFF5E>A geostorm.</font>

988
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:43,728
<font color=#FFFF5E>And unlike anything
we've ever seen.</font>

989
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:46,538
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dana, can you-can you
show us just uh,</font>

990
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:48,490
<font color=#FFFF5E>the simulation that
begins in Afghanistan?</font>

991
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:49,589
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, sure.</font>

992
00:59:52,746 --> 00:59:54,476
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, now, now filter those</font>

993
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,431
<font color=#FFFF5E>so that the second
malfunctions over Hong Kong.</font>

994
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:58,863
<font color=#FFFF5E>Where are you going with this?</font>

995
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:01,234
<font color=#FFFF5E>What if Cheng realized
that someone was</font>

996
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:03,392
<font color=#FFFF5E>following one of his scenarios?</font>

997
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:06,164
<font color=#FFFF5E>Making it look like
a predicted pattern of malfunction.</font>

998
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:08,833
<font color=#FFFF5E>Disguising a crime
like a series of accidents.</font>

999
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:10,326
<font color=#FFFF5E>It might actually be
a series of accidents.</font>

1000
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:12,692
<font color=#FFFF5E>If it were, they
wouldn't have killed him.</font>

1001
01:00:13,698 --> 01:00:16,434
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone has weaponized Dutch Boy.</font>

1002
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,800
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Virtual conference initiating.</i></font>

1003
01:00:21,112 --> 01:00:22,112
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Hey.</i></font>

1004
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:23,831
<font color=#FFFF5E>New face?</font>

1005
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:25,621
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, yeah, a friend.</font>

1006
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,875
<font color=#FFFF5E>She's keepin' things
off the monitors, chillin',</font>

1007
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:29,076
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>so, we're good.</i></font>

1008
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:31,499
<font color=#FFFF5E>- So, you got my message?
- Yeah, I got your message.</font>

1009
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:34,852
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's uh, it's worse than we thought.</font>

1010
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:38,947
<font color=#FFFF5E>Whoever's doing this is using
Dutch Boy to target cities.</font>

1011
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,871
<font color=#FFFF5E>And they're disguising
their moves as malfunctions.</font>

1012
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:44,071
<font color=#FFFF5E>They already killed the man
who found out about this.</font>

1013
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,544
<font color=#FFFF5E>And I don't think they're done.</font>

1014
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:46,946
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

1015
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:49,708
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is my life's work, Max.</font>

1016
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,879
<font color=#FFFF5E>You know, they said it was impossible,</font>

1017
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,880
<font color=#FFFF5E>but we pulled it off.</font>

1018
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:55,282
<font color=#FFFF5E>And it worked</font>

1019
01:00:55,383 --> 01:00:58,539
<font color=#FFFF5E>perfectly, without fail
day after day, year after year.</font>

1020
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,349
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, what do people do with it?</font>

1021
01:01:02,718 --> 01:01:04,088
<font color=#FFFF5E>Turn it into a gun.</font>

1022
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:05,389
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I know.</i></font>

1023
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,181
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>I know. It's not too late.
We can fix this</i></font>

1024
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:10,362
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>before it happens again,
but I can't do it on my own.</i></font>

1025
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:12,387
<font color=#FFFF5E>I need you. I need
you to tell me.</font>

1026
01:01:12,412 --> 01:01:13,911
<font color=#FFFF5E>How are they
controlling Dutch Boy?</font>

1027
01:01:14,112 --> 01:01:15,792
<font color=#FFFF5E>- I know how they're controlling it.
<i>- How?</i></font>

1028
01:01:16,002 --> 01:01:17,403
<font color=#FFFF5E>A virus.</font>

1029
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:19,131
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Well, could you stop it?</i></font>

1030
01:01:19,232 --> 01:01:20,232
<font color=#FFFF5E>There's only one way.</font>

1031
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:23,104
<font color=#FFFF5E>We can shut down
Dutch Boy temporarily.</font>

1032
01:01:23,962 --> 01:01:25,482
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>The reboot will
flush out the system,</i></font>

1033
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:28,828
<font color=#FFFF5E>kill the virus, and revert back
to the failsafe OS.</font>

1034
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:32,748
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay. Let's do it.</font>

1035
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:34,150
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then I'm authorizing.</font>

1036
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:37,577
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I think we've established
I don't really wait for that.</font>

1037
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:38,793
<font color=#FFFF5E>This isn't a Chromebook.</font>

1038
01:01:38,894 --> 01:01:40,370
<font color=#FFFF5E>You don't just put your
finger on the power button.</font>

1039
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,372
<font color=#FFFF5E>You need the kill codes.</font>

1040
01:01:43,419 --> 01:01:46,252
<font color=#FFFF5E>And the only one who has those
is the President.</font>

1041
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,649
<font color=#FFFF5E>So, let's just go to the President
and tell him what we know.</font>

1042
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,292
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. No.
You can't go to Palma.</font>

1043
01:01:52,235 --> 01:01:54,471
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We need way more
proof than I have.</i></font>

1044
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:56,094
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're talkin' about
shutting down Dutch Boy.</font>

1045
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,698
<font color=#FFFF5E>I mean even for an hour,
that puts the whole planet at risk.</font>

1046
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,927
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, I don't think you understand.</font>

1047
01:02:01,127 --> 01:02:03,313
<font color=#FFFF5E>Someone sealed off the
back door into the system.</font>

1048
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:06,679
<font color=#FFFF5E>A back door almost
no one knew existed.</font>

1049
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,273
<font color=#FFFF5E>But the President did.</font>

1050
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:11,088
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, Jake, come on, what?</font>

1051
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,490
<font color=#FFFF5E>Are you out of your mind?</font>

1052
01:02:12,592 --> 01:02:15,372
<font color=#FFFF5E>Not saying it's him.
I'm saying what if.</font>

1053
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:18,639
<font color=#FFFF5E>Who else has the
resources to pull this off?</font>

1054
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:22,160
<font color=#FFFF5E>Murder, cover-up, and a virus
that can only be stopped</font>

1055
01:02:22,264 --> 01:02:23,886
<font color=#FFFF5E>with the codes in his pocket.</font>

1056
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,307
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why? Huh, tell me. Why?
Why would he do that?</font>

1057
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,938
<font color=#FFFF5E>We're two weeks away</font>

1058
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:30,122
<font color=#FFFF5E>from transferring Dutch Boy
to the rest of the world.</font>

1059
01:02:30,215 --> 01:02:32,663
<font color=#FFFF5E>Two weeks away from
losing autonomous control.</font>

1060
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,460
<font color=#FFFF5E>Now, he talks a good game,
but he's never gonna let it happen.</font>

1061
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:40,244
<font color=#FFFF5E>A series of disasters, an
international crew to take the fall.</font>

1062
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:41,857
<font color=#FFFF5E>And you'd have to
cancel the hand-off.</font>

1063
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,605
<font color=#FFFF5E>And who would blame him?</font>

1064
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:48,373
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right. You stay on top
of your satellites.</font>

1065
01:02:50,293 --> 01:02:51,447
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max.</font>

1066
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:53,426
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, Max,
don't do anything stupid.</font>

1067
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:54,466
<font color=#FFFF5E>Let's go.</font>

1068
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:56,582
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Yeah, they already
tried to kill me once.</i></font>

1069
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:59,106
<font color=#FFFF5E>Max!</font>

1071
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:09,421
<font color=#FFFF5E>President Palma.
Some questions please, sir.</font>

1072
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:10,703
<font color=#FFFF5E>Comments before heading to the</font>

1073
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:12,382
<font color=#FFFF5E>national convention
in Orlando, sir?</font>

1074
01:03:12,682 --> 01:03:14,143
<font color=#FFFF5E>Mr. President,
is there any statement?</font>

1075
01:03:14,144 --> 01:03:15,544
<font color=#FFFF5E>A moment before
you head to Orlando.</font>

1076
01:03:15,606 --> 01:03:17,424
<font color=#FFFF5E>My friends from Washington, D.C.,</font>

1077
01:03:17,808 --> 01:03:19,169
<font color=#FFFF5E>I could never get off the plane</font>

1078
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:20,803
<font color=#FFFF5E>without first saying
hello to you.</font>

1079
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:22,105
<font color=#FFFF5E>Impossible.</font>

1080
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,367
<font color=#FFFF5E>What are you doing here?</font>

1081
01:03:29,845 --> 01:03:31,570
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Are you insane?
- Sarah, look.</font>

1082
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:35,192
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jake needs us to steal
the kill codes from Palma.</font>

1083
01:03:35,393 --> 01:03:36,393
<font color=#FFFF5E>Us?</font>

1084
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:38,112
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're asking me to help you</font>

1085
01:03:38,216 --> 01:03:39,509
<font color=#FFFF5E>on the word
of your asshole brother</font>

1086
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,189
<font color=#FFFF5E>who you haven't even
spoken to in three years!</font>

1087
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,190
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah.</font>

1088
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,152
<font color=#FFFF5E>Think about it, Afghanistan,
Hong Kong,</font>

1089
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:46,470
<font color=#FFFF5E>Cheng, the-the crazy sim shit,</font>

space station, come on?</font>

1091
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:51,109
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, you gotta trust me on this.
All right?</font>

1092
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,230
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not kidding around here.</font>

1093
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:55,157
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Okay.
- Look.</font>

1094
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:58,525
<font color=#FFFF5E>The codes are on
Palma's holoframe.</font>

1095
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:00,897
<font color=#FFFF5E>We can't do it on the plane.</font>

1096
01:04:00,927 --> 01:04:01,927
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why not?</font>

1097
01:04:02,028 --> 01:04:03,667
<font color=#FFFF5E>Too many eyes.
He's never alone.</font>

1098
01:04:03,768 --> 01:04:05,659
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, then-
then what's the play?</font>

1099
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,840
<font color=#FFFF5E>Palma likes some private time
to shower and make calls</font>

1100
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:11,212
<font color=#FFFF5E>before the after parties.</font>

1101
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:12,693
<font color=#FFFF5E>You follow, I'll get you inside.</font>

1102
01:04:12,763 --> 01:04:14,603
<font color=#FFFF5E>I can steal the codes
while he's in the shower.</font>

1103
01:04:14,703 --> 01:04:16,581
<font color=#FFFF5E>- That's the idea.
- Yes, it is.</font>

<font color=#FFFF5E>Four more years!</font>

1150
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:27,224
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Thank you.
As you know, the environment</i></font>

1151
01:08:27,325 --> 01:08:29,960
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>was my late wife's
great passion and purpose.</i></font>

1152
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,890
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>And I know that she
would be extremely proud...</i></font>

1153
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:34,210
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>caused by the worst
hailstorm in recorded history.</i></font>

1154
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,420
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>There has been another
extreme weather event,</i></font>

1155
01:08:36,524 --> 01:08:38,123
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>this time in Rio de Janeiro.</i></font>

1156
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:41,439
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>An off shore cold front
blew rapidly across land</i></font>

1157
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,696
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>plunging the city into
dangerously low temperatures.</i></font>

1158
01:08:43,896 --> 01:08:45,990
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>There are reports of
numerous casualties, but</i></font>

1159
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,103
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>we don't know
how many at this time.</i></font>

1160
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:49,605
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We're also hearing
that a cargo plane</i></font>

1161
01:08:49,606 --> 01:08:51,550
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>may have crashed
in the city itself</i></font>

1162
01:08:51,554 --> 01:08:53,657
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>possibly related
to the freezing cold.</i></font>

1163
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:56,978
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Tokyo and now Rio are the first
catastrophic weather events</i></font>

1164
01:08:57,042 --> 01:08:58,390
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>since the launch of Dutch Boy.</i></font>

1165
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,901
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Stay tuned after the break</i></font>

1166
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:01,860
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>when we're joined by
our reporter, Sally Jones.</i></font>

1167
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:06,988
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, God.</font>

1168
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:08,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hey, Max!</font>

1169
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:13,859
<font color=#FFFF5E>Where's your daddy?</font>

1170
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:14,963
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh...</font>

1171
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:16,476
<font color=#FFFF5E>Uh, you know what,
he got so caught</font>

1172
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:17,846
<font color=#FFFF5E>up in all the excitement, I-I...</font>

1173
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:20,260
<font color=#FFFF5E>I recruited you for this position.</font>

1174
01:09:20,362 --> 01:09:21,892
<font color=#FFFF5E>I know everything about you.</font>

1175
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:23,705
<font color=#FFFF5E>Your brother,
your mother's death,</font>

1176
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:26,141
<font color=#FFFF5E>your father's death, everything.</font>

1177
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:28,343
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why'd you lie to me?
Hmm?</font>

1178
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,230
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why'd you insist
on making this trip?</font>

1179
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:32,679
<font color=#FFFF5E>Tell me what's wrong.</font>

1180
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,882
<font color=#FFFF5E>Maybe I can help you.
Maybe I can't.</font>

1181
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,214
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, look.</font>

1182
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:39,366
<font color=#FFFF5E>I've gotta tell you something,
come here.</font>

1183
01:09:42,581 --> 01:09:45,380
<font color=#FFFF5E>We are 90 minutes away
from a global storm</font>

1184
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:46,990
<font color=#FFFF5E>we won't recover from.</font>

1185
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:49,016
<font color=#FFFF5E>And I need
the President's kill codes.</font>

1186
01:09:50,926 --> 01:09:51,947
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come again?</font>

1187
01:09:52,048 --> 01:09:53,641
<font color=#FFFF5E>We gotta shut
Dutch Boy down now.</font>

1188
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:55,143
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're serious.</font>

1189
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:57,551
<font color=#FFFF5E>You said you hired me
because you believed in me, right?</font>

1190
01:09:58,022 --> 01:10:00,903
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, well, I need you
to believe in me now.</font>

1191
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:06,646
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, we've gotta brief
the President.</font>

1192
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>Get to Cape Canaveral.</font>

1193
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:09,853
<font color=#FFFF5E>No, no, no, no.
W-We can't do that, sir.</font>

1194
01:10:10,153 --> 01:10:11,154
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why not?</font>

1195
01:10:11,255 --> 01:10:13,384
<font color=#FFFF5E>I believe he's the one
who initiated it.</font>

1196
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:15,080
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>United we stand.</i></font>

1197
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,273
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>United, we can.</i></font>

1198
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:21,159
<font color=#FFFF5E>Four more years!</font>

1199
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,050
<font color=#FFFF5E>You better be goddamn
sure of yourself</font>

1200
01:10:23,154 --> 01:10:24,435
<font color=#FFFF5E>making accusations like that.</font>

1201
01:10:24,546 --> 01:10:26,268
<font color=#FFFF5E>With all due respect, we don't
have time to argue about this.</font>

1202
01:10:26,269 --> 01:10:27,296
<font color=#FFFF5E>Palma and I go way back.</font>

1203
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why would he do that?
That's insane.</font>

1204
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,126
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, well, he's doin' it.</font>

1205
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,228
<font color=#FFFF5E>What's your proof?</font>

1206
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:34,248
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, I got proof.
Dozens of files, right?</font>

1207
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:36,263
<font color=#FFFF5E>Project Zeus. It's all there.</font>

1208
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,820
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, we can't get the
kill codes from the President.</font>

1209
01:10:41,228 --> 01:10:42,228
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why not?</font>

1210
01:10:42,362 --> 01:10:45,003
<font color=#FFFF5E>'Cause the President
<i>is</i> the kill codes.</font>

1211
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:48,374
<font color=#FFFF5E>Biometrics. Ten fingerprints,
two retina scans.</font>

1212
01:10:49,505 --> 01:10:50,648
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, what do we do?</font>

1213
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:53,308
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll have to reason with him.</font>

1214
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:55,244
<font color=#FFFF5E>We'll have to reason with him.</font>

1215
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:57,205
<font color=#FFFF5E>Satellites going critical
over Florida.</font>

1216
01:10:57,406 --> 01:10:58,984
<font color=#FFFF5E>Go to replacement sat now.</font>

1217
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:03,387
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Station self-destruct
sequence initiated.</i></font>

1218
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:07,610
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Station self-destruct
sequence initiated.</i></font>

1219
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:10,121
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Phase one commencing now.</i></font>

1220
01:11:11,179 --> 01:11:12,656
<font color=#FFFF5E>Great. Shut that down!</font>

1221
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:13,972
<font color=#FFFF5E>I can't, I'm locked out.</font>

1222
01:11:14,526 --> 01:11:16,184
<font color=#FFFF5E>We built in back door overrides.</font>

1223
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,430
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm trying them!</font>

1224
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,179
<font color=#FFFF5E>If we lose the station, we won't</font>

1225
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,500
<font color=#FFFF5E>be able to control
the satellites.</font>

1226
01:11:21,551 --> 01:11:22,906
<font color=#FFFF5E>Self-destruct?</font>

1227
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:25,450
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why would you build
that into the station?</font>

1228
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:27,587
<font color=#FFFF5E>In case it fell to Earth.</font>

1229
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:29,352
<font color=#FFFF5E>Where's Duncan?</font>

1230
01:11:29,446 --> 01:11:31,446
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's the only one with
enough programming expertise</font>

1231
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,838
<font color=#FFFF5E>to override the commands.</font>

1232
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,275
<font color=#FFFF5E>Duncan.</font>

1233
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:43,376
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's the fuel tanks.</font>

1234
01:11:43,444 --> 01:11:44,670
<font color=#FFFF5E>They're the first to go.</font>

1235
01:11:44,694 --> 01:11:47,124
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then section by section
until it can't handle retrieval.</font>

1236
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:49,164
<font color=#FFFF5E>Okay, everybody
get to the shuttles!</font>

1237
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:50,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>Evacuate!</font>

1238
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,175
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, we gotta hurry!</font>

1239
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:53,490
<font color=#FFFF5E>Go, go, go!</font>

1240
01:11:57,798 --> 01:12:00,034
<font color=#FFFF5E>Jake. What are you
still doing here?</font>

1241
01:12:01,645 --> 01:12:02,818
<font color=#FFFF5E>That felt good.</font>

1242
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:05,281
<font color=#FFFF5E>I wanted to do that
since I first met you.</font>

1243
01:12:05,468 --> 01:12:06,468
<font color=#FFFF5E>Have you gone mad?</font>

1244
01:12:06,596 --> 01:12:07,891
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, pretty much.</font>

1245
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:09,829
<font color=#FFFF5E>The virus?</font>

1246
01:12:10,286 --> 01:12:12,409
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're the only one who
could've put it in the system.</font>

1247
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,790
<font color=#FFFF5E>The only one who could've
sealed off the back door.</font>

1248
01:12:17,524 --> 01:12:19,644
<font color=#FFFF5E>The only one who could've
helped them pulled this off.</font>

1249
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,951
<font color=#FFFF5E>I need the overrides for the
self-destruct to the station, now!</font>

1250
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,808
<font color=#FFFF5E>I mean, what for?</font>

1251
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,872
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm not gonna be here
when it blows.</font>

1252
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:31,104
<font color=#FFFF5E>But you will.</font>

1253
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:35,446
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come on, man.
Why did you do it?</font>

1254
01:12:35,575 --> 01:12:39,660
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, you know what us
lowly scientists get paid?</font>

1255
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:41,890
<font color=#FFFF5E>Take that times a thousand.</font>

1256
01:12:42,177 --> 01:12:43,362
<font color=#FFFF5E>What difference is it gonna make?</font>

1257
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,900
<font color=#FFFF5E>If you don't stop, there's not
gonna be a planet to spend it on.</font>

1258
01:12:46,104 --> 01:12:48,705
<font color=#FFFF5E>Please. We're gonna
keep all the best bits.</font>

1259
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:51,594
<font color=#FFFF5E>Aren't you a little bit curious
to watch the world...</font>

1260
01:12:51,798 --> 01:12:53,133
<font color=#FFFF5E>burn?</font>

1261
01:12:53,712 --> 01:12:56,678
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. 'Cause millions
of people are gonna die.</font>

1262
01:12:58,119 --> 01:12:59,641
<font color=#FFFF5E>One of them's my daughter.</font>

1263
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:30,073
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, shit.</font>

1264
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,973
<font color=#FFFF5E>Holding room for the President
down on the left.</font>

1265
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:44,475
<font color=#FFFF5E>We'll confront him there.</font>

1266
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:47,166
<font color=#FFFF5E>Project Zeus.</font>

1267
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:49,318
<font color=#FFFF5E>Did Cheng tell you anything else?</font>

1268
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:53,605
<font color=#FFFF5E>Cheng?</font>

1269
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:05,059
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>This president knows that hope
is not a plan.</i></font>

1270
01:14:05,339 --> 01:14:06,527
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>This president knows...</i></font>

1271
01:14:06,728 --> 01:14:08,368
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>that despite how far we've come...</i></font>

1272
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,468
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>there is much more work ahead.</i></font>

1273
01:14:12,432 --> 01:14:14,258
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Working to save our planet...</i></font>

1274
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:18,299
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>is my first priority as vice president.</i></font>

1275
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:21,733
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>This is but a stepping stone
for the success...</i></font>

1276
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:26,395
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>and greatness that can and
will be the future of our society.</i></font>

1277
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:27,596
<font color=#FFFF5E>Excuse me.</font>

1278
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:30,441
<font color=#FFFF5E>That's why I'm here tonight
with the Speaker of the House...</font>

1279
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:34,265
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>the senate pro tempore,
and President Palma's whole cabinet.</i></font>

1280
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:36,442
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>We all stand united to support...</i></font>

1281
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:37,983
<font color=#FFFF5E>Palma doesn't leave the building.</font>

1282
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:39,548
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.</font>

1283
01:14:44,019 --> 01:14:45,019
<font color=#FFFF5E>Where have you been?</font>

1284
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,948
<font color=#FFFF5E>Come here, come here.</font>

1285
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,183
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's not the President, all right?
It's Dekkom.</font>

1286
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,070
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dekkom?
H-How do you know?</font>

1287
01:14:51,272 --> 01:14:53,419
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because he just tried to kill me.
That's how I know.</font>

1288
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,968
<font color=#FFFF5E>Look, the sim shows Orlando
is the next city to be hit.</font>

1289
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:59,309
<font color=#FFFF5E>Here?
Why would he do that?</font>

1290
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:01,801
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because Dekkom wants Palma
trapped here, all right?</font>

1291
01:15:01,846 --> 01:15:04,828
<font color=#FFFF5E>And everyone else who's
next in line for the presidency.</font>

1292
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,055
<font color=#FFFF5E>Are we still stealing the codes?</font>

1293
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:11,935
<font color=#FFFF5E>The President is the kill codes,
all right? They're biometric.</font>

1294
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:14,323
<font color=#FFFF5E>If Palma dies, Dutch Boy
can't be stopped.</font>

1295
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:15,520
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sure, kidnap the President. That</font>

1296
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:16,787
<font color=#FFFF5E>sounds like the reasonable move.</font>

1297
01:15:16,788 --> 01:15:18,595
<font color=#FFFF5E>Well, it's the only move we've got.</font>

1298
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,574
<font color=#FFFF5E>Unless you wanna steal his
fingers and his eyes.</font>

1299
01:15:21,678 --> 01:15:22,678
<font color=#FFFF5E>Huh?</font>

1300
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:29,701
<font color=#FFFF5E>We go now.</font>

1301
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:31,223
<font color=#FFFF5E>You get us a car.</font>

1302
01:15:32,325 --> 01:15:33,541
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'll get us a president.</font>

1303
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,087
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, good.</font>

1304
01:15:35,388 --> 01:15:39,844
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>The program did not gain
immense international support...</i></font>

1305
01:15:40,045 --> 01:15:41,973
<font color=#FFFF5E>Gunman spotted.
POTUS is compromised.</font>

1306
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:44,627
<font color=#FFFF5E>Evac to secure location: Alpha.</font>

1307
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:47,197
<font color=#FFFF5E>Get him out! Get him out!</font>

1308
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:56,829
<font color=#FFFF5E>Go, go, go, go, go!</font>

1309
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:07,907
<font color=#FFFF5E>Secret Service!
Get back! Get back!</font>

1310
01:16:08,008 --> 01:16:09,168
<font color=#FFFF5E>You got a 20 on the shooters?</font>

1311
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,821
<font color=#FFFF5E>From mezzanine by exit 212.
Two men with automatics.</font>

1312
01:16:12,023 --> 01:16:13,577
<font color=#FFFF5E>- I'm on it. You get POTUS.
- You two...</font>

1313
01:16:13,578 --> 01:16:15,543
<font color=#FFFF5E>Secure this entrance.
No one come down this hallway.</font>

1314
01:16:15,544 --> 01:16:17,224
<font color=#FFFF5E>Nobody gets through!
Hard room, Lammy.</font>

1315
01:16:17,517 --> 01:16:18,775
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Got it!
- You two...</font>

1316
01:16:18,976 --> 01:16:20,456
<font color=#FFFF5E>Clear the emergency exit now!</font>

1317
01:16:27,801 --> 01:16:29,020
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm sorry, Mr. President.</font>

1318
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:31,070
<font color=#FFFF5E>You need to come with me.</font>

1319
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:35,390
<font color=#FFFF5E>This exit is off limits!</font>

1320
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,423
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Please remain calm.</i></font>

1321
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:42,209
<font color=#FFFF5E>Seriously?
A self-driving cab?</font>

1322
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,418
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dana jacked it remotely.
It was all I could get.</font>

1323
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:45,820
<font color=#FFFF5E>What the hell's
going on here­, Lawson?</font>

1324
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:48,329
<font color=#FFFF5E>Please, please, sir. Look,
I'll explain everything in the car.</font>

1325
01:16:48,631 --> 01:16:51,083
<font color=#FFFF5E>Please, sir!
We don't have much time!</font>

1326
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:08,821
<font color=#FFFF5E>Keep moving!
Get to the shuttles!</font>

1327
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,494
<font color=#FFFF5E>Keep going!</font>

1328
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:12,796
<font color=#FFFF5E>Quick!</font>

1329
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:17,876
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Time to geostorm: 55 minutes.</i></font>

1330
01:17:36,975 --> 01:17:38,347
<font color=#FFFF5E>Sir, I can barely hear you.</font>

1331
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:40,056
<font color=#FFFF5E>The storm is causing
too much static.</font>

1332
01:17:40,257 --> 01:17:42,314
<font color=#FFFF5E>The Secret Service will be
homing in on the beacon</font>

1333
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:43,733
<font color=#FFFF5E>on the President's holoframe.</font>

1334
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:45,640
<font color=#FFFF5E>You gotta get to him
before they do.</font>

1335
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:48,990
<font color=#FFFF5E>Under no circumstances can he
make it out of Orlando.</font>

1336
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:51,685
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>Our man on the
space station did his job.</i></font>

1337
01:17:51,886 --> 01:17:54,312
<font color=#FFFF5E><i>- Now you do yours.</i>
- Copy that. Got it.</font>

1338
01:17:59,627 --> 01:18:02,017
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Dekkom?
- It's the perfect weapon, sir.</font>

1339
01:18:02,118 --> 01:18:04,438
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right? Dekkom is trying
to change the map of the world.</font>

1340
01:18:04,552 --> 01:18:06,152
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then what? Blame it on
a computer glitch?</font>

1341
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:08,868
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, that and a dead president.</font>

1342
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:10,885
<font color=#FFFF5E>He'll take office
after wiping out</font>

1343
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,907
<font color=#FFFF5E>everyone in the
line of succession.</font>

1344
01:18:23,259 --> 01:18:24,306
<font color=#FFFF5E>Dear God.</font>

1345
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:46,882
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Get to cover, under the bridge!
- Sir.</font>

1346
01:19:29,007 --> 01:19:31,399
<font color=#FFFF5E>You are implicating the
Secretary of State in this.</font>

1347
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:32,629
<font color=#FFFF5E>You realize you're committing...</font>

1348
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,464
<font color=#FFFF5E>- treason?
- Treason.</font>

1349
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,133
<font color=#FFFF5E>Oh, yeah, I kidnapped the President,
I've stolen state secrets.</font>

1350
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:38,436
<font color=#FFFF5E>Anything I'm forgetting, honey?</font>

1351
01:19:38,993 --> 01:19:40,208
<font color=#FFFF5E>Honey?</font>

1352
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,610
<font color=#FFFF5E>Guilty.</font>

1353
01:19:41,742 --> 01:19:43,462
<font color=#FFFF5E>It took years for
Dekkom to plan this, sir.</font>

1354
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:45,463
<font color=#FFFF5E>President's schedule always
changes last minute.</font>

1355
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:48,024
<font color=#FFFF5E>This is the one day and date
he could be sure wouldn't move.</font>

1356
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:50,160

leave the investigation</font>

1357
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,513
<font color=#FFFF5E>was a setup from the start.</font>

1358
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,680
<font color=#FFFF5E>Think about it.</font>

1359
01:19:52,882 --> 01:19:54,491
<font color=#FFFF5E>He hired us to fail.</font>

1360
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:57,281
<font color=#FFFF5E>Get down!</font>

1361
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,069
<font color=#FFFF5E>All right, it says we're
back in the clear.</font>

1362
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,412
<font color=#FFFF5E>We've got four minutes to 91.</font>

1363
01:20:51,425 --> 01:20:53,305
<font color=#FFFF5E>Just gotta take care
of a little problem, first.</font>

1364
01:21:07,748 --> 01:21:08,748
<font color=#FFFF5E>Hold on!</font>

1365
01:21:11,222 --> 01:21:12,381
<font color=#FFFF5E>Woo!</font>

1366
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,306
<font color=#FFFF5E>Marry her.</font>

1367
01:21:54,981 --> 01:21:56,195
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. We're fine here.</font>

I don't know.</font>

1372
01:22:07,075 --> 01:22:09,204
<font color=#FFFF5E>I just can't get in touch with Jake.</font>

<font color=#FFFF5E>I-I can't get through to him.
Has he texted you? Or...</font>

1377
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:21,270
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's not there.</font>

1378
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,088

- What?</font>

1386
01:22:54,852 --> 01:22:56,432
<font color=#FFFF5E>When my brother
gets those kill codes,</font>

1387
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,290
<font color=#FFFF5E>someone has to be here
to execute the program.</font>

1388
01:22:58,312 --> 01:22:59,551
<font color=#FFFF5E>No. We need to go.</font>

1389
01:22:59,752 --> 01:23:01,183
<font color=#FFFF5E>We haven't heard
from him in hours.</font>

1390
01:23:01,484 --> 01:23:02,784
<font color=#FFFF5E>I trust him.</font>

1391
01:23:02,952 --> 01:23:05,466
<font color=#FFFF5E>You know the reboot
has to be done manually.</font>

1392
01:23:05,668 --> 01:23:07,108
<font color=#FFFF5E>Then I stay.
I'm the commander.</font>

1393
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:08,359
<font color=#FFFF5E>No.</font>

would trust with the codes, so.</font>

1395
01:23:12,777 --> 01:23:14,056
<font color=#FFFF5E>I need your holoframe.</font>

1396
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:21,479
<font color=#FFFF5E>You have to insert it manually
at the core of the mainframe.</font>

1397
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:24,573
<font color=#FFFF5E>You can find it, yes?</font>

1398
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:26,311
<font color=#FFFF5E>- Yes.
- Good.</font>

1401
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:45,857
<font color=#FFFF5E>Pull over here.</font>

him heading right towards us.</font>

1403

drive back into that?</font>

1404
01:23:54,938 --> 01:23:59,105
<font color=#FFFF5E>Yeah, right after it passes,
I'll be the sole survivor...</font>

1405
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:02,896

next President of the United States.</font>

<font color=#FFFF5E>Here they come.</font>

1407
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,491
<font color=#FFFF5E>Fire.</font>

1408
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,140
<font color=#FFFF5E>You thought the President was
the only one who could be tracked?</font>

1409
01:25:02,078 --> 01:25:03,833
<font color=#FFFF5E>- How the hell did you?
- How?</font>

1410
01:25:04,344 --> 01:25:05,884
<font color=#FFFF5E>'Cause I'm the goddamn President</font>

1411
01:25:05,909 --> 01:25:07,571

1412
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:09,612
<font color=#FFFF5E>You're done, Leonard.</font>

1413
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:16,724
<font color=#FFFF5E>He's all yours.</font>

1414
01:25:21,985 --> 01:25:23,105
<font color=#FFFF5E>Wait, wait, wait a minute.</font>

1415
01:25:23,296 --> 01:25:25,337
<font color=#FFFF5E>I've given you an opportunity,
Mr. President.</font>

1416
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,081
<font color=#FFFF5E>You should take it.</font>

1417
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:28,661
<font color=#FFFF5E>An opportunity?
Let him go.</font>

1418
01:25:29,773 --> 01:25:31,036
<font color=#FFFF5E>It's genocide, Leonard!</font>

1419
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:34,002
<font color=#FFFF5E>You say genocide,
I say preemptive strike.</font>

1420
01:25:34,202 --> 01:25:35,202
<font color=#FFFF5E>You've lost your mind!</font>

1421
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:38,585
<font color=#FFFF5E>Tomorrow, the sun will rise,
all our enemies will be gone.</font>

1422
01:25:38,986 --> 01:25:41,615
<font color=#FFFF5E>Wiped away as if
by the hand of God!</font>

1423
01:25:43,288 --> 01:25:44,593
<font color=#FFFF5E>Why would you do this?</font>

1424
01:25:44,794 --> 01:25:46,595
<font color=#FFFF5E>Because no one else would.</font>

1425
01:25:46,796 --> 01:25:49,009
<font color=#FFFF5E>I'm turning the clock
back to 1945...</font>

1426
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,671
<font color=#FFFF5E>when America was
a shining city on a hill...</font>

1427
01:25:51,718 --> 01:25:53,570
<font color=#FFFF5E>not just a bank
disguised as a country.</font>

1428
01:25:53,696 --> 01:25:54,697
<font color=#FFFF5E>By playing God?</font>

1429
01:25:54,898 --> 01:25:57,642
<font color=#FFFF5E>What the hell is Dutch Boy
if not playing God?</font>

1430
01:25:57,843 --> 01:25:59,476
